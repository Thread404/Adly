# Adly

Adly.ai is an AI tool that generates advertisement posters and captions for the poster using only text inputs from the user describing the poster. This app has the following features:
- Text-to-image generation
- Text-to-text generation
- Text editor tools
- image uploads and downloads

For future updates, the application will have the following features:
- Basic shapes drawing tools
- Free-form drawing tools
- Image filtering
- Image segmentation

Adly.ai uses diffusion models to generate images from text and from that text, it also uses transformers to generate text captions (with proper prompt engineering) for the image based on the given image description.

# How to Use
First, click on the new projects to create a new project file. 

After creating a project, you will see output poster dimensions in square, portrait, and landscape. We chose the square dimension for this demonstration.

Then, when you see the message in the main dashboard, you may now input your prompt in the prompt container below then click send.

Once the models generate the image and caption outputs from the text, you can now edit the poster using the text editor. Click on the text editor button on the right sidebar to reveal the settings. You can adjust the color, style, and size of the text. 

After editing, you may download the poster as a png file and copy its caption on the tab. We are now ready to publish this on our social media account.
